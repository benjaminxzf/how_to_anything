  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "total_time": "4-6 weeks of consistent practice",
  "tools_required": [
    "Comfortable athletic clothing",

      "title": "The Foundation: Establishing the All-Fours Posture",
      "description": "Begin on your hands and knees on a soft surface. Position your hands directly under your shoulders, shoulder-width apart. Spread your fingers wide to create a stable base and distribute pressure. Your knees should be directly under your hips, hip-width apart. Engage your core by drawing your navel towards your spine. Keep your back relatively flat and your gaze directed slightly forward, not straight down. This is your starting 'quadrupedal' stance.",
      "tips": [
        "Press firmly through your palms and knuckles to avoid putting all the pressure on your wrists.",
        "Imagine a straight line from the crown of your head to your tailbone."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Avoid locking your elbows; keep a micro-bend in them to act as shock absorbers."

He is in a perfect all-fours position, hands directly under shoulders, knees under hips. His fingers are spread wide on the grass, his back is flat, and his core is visibly engaged. He wears athletic shorts, a t-shirt, and padded gloves. The lighting is bright, natural sunlight, creating soft shadows. The background is a slightly blurred park setting."

      "title": "The Engine: Activating the Spinal Wave",
      "description": "From the all-fours posture, begin a 'Cat-Cow' stretch to mobilize your spine. Inhale as you drop your belly towards the ground, arching your back and looking up (Cow). Exhale as you round your spine towards the sky, tucking your chin to your chest (Cat). Perform 10-15 repetitions slowly. The goal is to develop the fluid spinal flexion and extension that powers a cat's gallop. Focus on initiating the movement from your tailbone and letting it ripple up your spine to your head.",
      "tips": [
        "Synchronize your breath with the movement for a smoother motion.",
        "Try to feel each individual vertebra moving."

      "title": "The Launch: The Hind Leg Bound",
      "description": "From the all-fours posture, lower your hips back towards your heels into a deep crouch, keeping your hands planted. This loads your leg muscles. In one explosive but controlled movement, push powerfully off both feet, propelling your hips up and forward. Aim to land softly back on your feet in a crouched position, a short distance from where you started, with your hands landing just after. Start with very small 'bounds' of only 1-2 feet. This exercise isolates the powerful hip extension that initiates the gallop.",
      "tips": [
        "Focus on landing as quietly as possible to practice shock absorption.",
        "Keep your core tight throughout the movement to maintain stability."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Ensure your knees track over your toes during the push-off and landing to protect the knee joint.",

The motion is frozen with a fast shutter speed, showing blades of grass kicked up slightly. Bright, natural sunlight illuminates the scene."

      "title": "The Reach: Extending the Forelimbs",
      "description": "This step coordinates the upper body. After the hind leg bound, as your body moves forward, you must consciously reach forward with your hands to extend your stride and prepare for landing. Practice the bound from Step 3, but now focus on reaching your hands forward as far as you comfortably can before they touch the ground. This creates the elongated 'suspension' phase of the gallop. Your body should be almost parallel to the ground at the peak of the reach.",
      "tips": [
        "Think of 'throwing' your hands forward.",
        "Engage your lats and shoulder muscles to control the reach and landing."

      "title": "Coordination: The Transverse Gallop",
      "description": "Now, combine the movements into a slow, deliberate gallop. The sequence is: Back Right foot pushes, then Back Left foot pushes. This propels you into the air (suspension phase from Step 4). Then, Front Right hand lands, followed by Front Left hand. As your hands land, immediately begin to bring your knees forward under your body to prepare for the next push-off. The rhythm is 'back-back, front-front' with a pause in between. Practice this sequence slowly, walking through it for 5-10 meters at a time.",
      "tips": [
        "Say the rhythm out loud: 'Right-Left... Right-Left' to help with coordination.",
        "Keep your movements low to the ground initially to maintain control."

      "title": "Flow and Refinement: Increasing Speed and Distance",
      "description": "Once you are comfortable with the slow-motion gallop, you can begin to link the movements together more fluidly and increase your speed. Focus on making the transitions seamless. Push off more powerfully with your legs and reach further with your arms. Your spine should now be actively flexing and extending with each stride, like a whip. Practice in short bursts of 15-20 meters, focusing on maintaining good form rather than maximum speed.",
      "tips": [
        "Focus on efficiency. Use the minimum energy necessary for each movement.",
        "Breathe deeply and rhythmically. Try to exhale on the landing to brace your core."
