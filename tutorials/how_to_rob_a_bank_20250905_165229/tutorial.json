      "description": "Measure and cut your craft wood or foam board to create the outer box of your book nook. A standard size is around 9.5\" tall, 3.5\" wide, and 8\" deep, but you can adjust to fit your shelf. Cut two side walls, a top, a bottom, a back, and a floor piece. Assemble the main box (sides, top, bottom, back) using wood glue, ensuring all corners are square. Let it dry completely.",
      "tips": [
        "Use clamps or heavy books to hold the pieces together firmly while the glue dries.",

Paint the interior walls with a base color.",
