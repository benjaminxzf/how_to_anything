Using the correct size wrench (usually 10mm), loosen the nut on the negative terminal clamp. You only need to loosen it enough to wiggle the cable off. Once loose, pull the cable clamp up and away from the battery post and tuck it to the side where it cannot accidentally touch the terminal again.",
