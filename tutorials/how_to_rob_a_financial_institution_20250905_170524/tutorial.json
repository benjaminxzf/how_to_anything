      "description": "From the main game lobby, invite three other players to form a four-person squad. Navigate to the 'Loadout' screen for the 'Data Bank Heist' mission. Ensure your team has a balanced composition: one 'Hacker' class to bypass electronic security, one 'Infiltrator' class with a cloaking device, and two 'Mercenary' classes for combat support. Equip EMP grenades and armor-piercing rounds.",
      "tips": [
        "Communication is key. Use your headset to coordinate roles and strategies before launching the mission.",

The 'Infiltrator' must use their cloaking ability to cross the street and disable the main security camera located above the entrance. Once the camera is disabled (indicated by its red light turning off), the rest of the team has a 60-second window to enter the lobby before a patrol discovers the disabled camera.",
      "tips": [

The other three squad members must defend the Hacker's position from waves of NPC security guards that spawn in the area.",
