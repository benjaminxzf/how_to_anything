  "total_time": "45-60 minutes per practice session",

      "title": "The Stalking Stance: Master the Forward Lean",
      "description": "Cats run with their center of gravity slightly forward, allowing them to fall into each step. To mimic this, stand tall and lean forward from your ankles, not your waist. Maintain a straight line from your head, through your hips, to your heels. You should feel like you're about to fall forward, forcing you to take a step to catch yourself. This is your new running posture.",
      "tips": [
        "Practice this against a wall. Stand a foot away and lean forward until your hands catch you. This helps you feel the correct ankle-driven lean.",
        "Keep your core engaged to prevent your back from arching or your hips from sagging."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Do not bend at the waist. This puts strain on your lower back and is an inefficient posture."

The runner is demonstrating a proper forward lean from the ankles, creating a straight, diagonal line from head to heels. The background is softly blurred, focusing on the runner's impeccable posture."

      "title": "Silent Paws: Perfecting the Mid-Foot Strike",
      "description": "Cats land silently and lightly on the pads of their paws. Your goal is to land on your mid-foot, directly underneath your body's center of mass (your hips). Avoid 'reaching' with your foot and landing heavily on your heel far in front of you. Practice jogging in place, focusing on landing on the ball of your foot, then let that motion carry you forward.",
      "tips": [
        "Try running barefoot on a safe surface (like grass) for a few minutes to naturally feel what a mid-foot strike is like.",
        "Think 'light and quiet'. If you can hear your feet slapping the pavement, you are landing too heavily."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Transitioning to a mid-foot strike too quickly can strain your calves and Achilles tendons. Start with short distances and build up gradually over several weeks."

The runner's other leg is pushing off in the background, slightly blurred."

      "step_number": 3,
      "title": "The Pounce: Increase Cadence and Knee Drive",
      "description": "A cat's power comes from a rapid leg turnover. Focus on taking more steps per minute (cadence), rather than longer strides. Aim for a cadence of around 170-180 steps per minute. Use a quick, powerful but not exaggerated knee drive to propel yourself forward, imagining you're pushing the ground away behind you like a cat pouncing.",
      "tips": [
        "Use a running watch with a cadence tracker or a metronome app set to 175 bpm to help you find the rhythm.",
        "Think 'run over the ground, not into it'. Your steps should be quick, light, and springy."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Don't force a high knee drive like a sprinter; it should be a natural and efficient part of your faster cadence."

The lighting is soft morning sun, creating a slight motion blur to convey speed."

      "title": "The Relaxed Hunter: Upper Body Form",
      "description": "Watch a cat run; its upper body is fluid and relaxed, channeling all energy into forward motion. Keep your shoulders down and loose, away from your ears. Let your arms swing forward and back from the shoulder, not side-to-side across your body. Keep your hands unclenched, as if you're lightly holding a potato chip without breaking it.",
      "tips": [
        "Before you run, shake out your arms and hands to release tension.",
        "Periodically check in during your run. Are your shoulders creeping up? Are your fists clenched? If so, take a deep breath and relax."

The early morning light softly illuminates the scene."

      "title": "The Bounding Sprint: Putting It All Together",
      "description": "Now, combine all the elements. Start with a slow jog, focusing on form. Then, perform short sprints (50-100 meters) where you concentrate on executing all the techniques together: the forward lean, the light mid-foot strike, the quick cadence, and the relaxed upper body. Focus on the feeling of effortless, powerful, and fluid motion, like a cat in full chase.",
      "tips": [
        "Don't go for maximum speed at first. Focus on perfect form at 70-80% effort.",
        "Walk or jog slowly for recovery between sprints to maintain good form on each repetition."

  "safety_notes": [
    "Always warm up before each session with 5-10 minutes of light jogging and dynamic stretches.",
    "If you are new to running or are changing your form, start slowly and with shorter distances to allow your muscles and tendons to adapt.",
    "Listen to your body. If you feel any sharp or persistent pain, stop and rest. Consult a doctor or physical therapist if the pain continues.",
    "Cool down after each run with 5 minutes of walking and static stretching for your major leg muscles."
