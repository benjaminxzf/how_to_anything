      "description": "Stand in front of a mirror with your shirt collar turned up. Drape the tie around your neck, underneath the collar. The wide end of the tie should hang on your dominant side (e.g., your right side if you are right-handed), and the narrow end on the other. Adjust the tie so the wide end hangs about 12 inches (30 cm) lower than the narrow end. The seam of the tie should be facing your shirt.",
      "tips": [
        "The tip of the wide end will determine the final length of your tie, so starting it significantly lower is crucial. A good starting point is to have the tip of the narrow end near your navel."
