Attach the rack towers to these points according to your rack manufacturer's instructions, ensuring they are level and parallel. A typical spread between the bars is 24-30 inches. Tighten all bolts to the specified torque using the provided tool.",

Remove the kayak and then fully tighten the carrier's hardware.",
