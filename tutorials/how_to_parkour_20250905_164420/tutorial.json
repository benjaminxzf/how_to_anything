      "title": "Foundation: Conditioning and Warm-up",
      "description": "Before attempting any parkour movements, it's crucial to prepare your body. Perform a 10-15 minute warm-up including jogging, jumping jacks, and dynamic stretches like leg swings and arm circles. Follow this with conditioning exercises: 3 sets of 15 squats, 10 push-ups, and a 30-second plank to build foundational strength.",
      "tips": [
        "Focus on proper form over speed.",
        "Listen to your body; don't push through sharp pain."

      "title": "Master the Safety Roll (Roulade)",
      "description": "The safety roll distributes the impact of a jump or fall across your body to prevent injury. Start from a squat. Fall forward diagonally, tucking your chin to your chest. Make contact with the ground with the back of your shoulder (opposite to your leading foot), roll diagonally across your back, and come up on the opposite foot, ready to move. Practice on soft grass or a mat first.",
      "tips": [
        "Think of it as rolling like a ball, not a log.",
        "Keep your body rounded and avoid landing flat on your back or hips."

        "Do not practice this on concrete until you have mastered it on a soft surface.",
        "Avoid landing directly on your shoulder joint or spine."

The background is slightly blurred, showing the same park setting."

      "title": "Executing the Precision Jump",
      "description": "A precision jump is about landing accurately on a small target. Start with a short distance (2-3 feet) on the ground, marking a take-off and landing line. Swing your arms back, then forward and up as you jump. Aim to land on the balls of your feet, absorbing the impact by bending your knees. Your feet should land silently and precisely on the target line.",
      "tips": [
        "Keep your eyes on your landing spot throughout the jump.",
        "Practice 'sticking' the landing without taking extra steps.",
        "Start with ground-level targets before moving to elevated ones."
      ],
      "warnings": [
        "Ensure your landing surface is stable and not slippery.",
        "Master the distance on the ground before attempting jumps between objects."

The person is wearing athletic shoes. The golden hour lighting casts long shadows, emphasizing the precision and control of the landing. The photo has a shallow depth of field, with the background park elements softly out of focus."

      "title": "Developing Your Balance",
      "description": "Balance is key. Start by walking along a line on the ground. Once comfortable, progress to a low, wide curb or railing. Walk forward, backward, and even try turning around. Keep your arms out to the side for balance, your core engaged, and your eyes focused on a point in the distance, not your feet.",
      "tips": [

        "Slightly bend your knees to lower your center of gravity."

        "Only use railings and ledges that are low to the ground (no more than 1-2 feet high).",

      "description": "The safety vault is a simple way to get over low obstacles. Approach a low wall or bench (waist-high or lower). Place your inside hand on the obstacle. Step up onto the obstacle with your inside foot. As you move over, place your outside hand down and swing your outside leg through the gap. Land softly on the other side.",
      "tips": [
        "Keep your movements smooth and controlled, not rushed.",
        "This vault is about safety and control, not speed."

      "description": "The speed vault allows you to clear an obstacle while maintaining momentum. Approach the obstacle (waist-high or lower) from a slight angle. Plant your inside hand on the obstacle and push off, kicking your legs up and sideways to clear it. Your body should be nearly parallel to the ground as you pass over. Land on your outside foot first, ready to continue running.",

        "Generate momentum from your run-up.",
