      "title": "Pre-Drive Cockpit Familiarization",
      "description": "Before starting the car, sit in the driver's seat and familiarize yourself with the primary controls. Identify the steering wheel, the two pedals on the floor (the wider one on the left is the brake, the narrower one on the right is the accelerator/gas), the gear selector (usually labeled P, R, N, D), the parking brake (either a lever between the seats or a small pedal to the far left), and the ignition (either a key slot or a push-to-start button). Locate the controls for headlights, turn signals, and windshield wipers.",
      "tips": [
        "Do this with the engine completely off to safely learn the layout without any risk of accidental movement.",

      "title": "Adjusting Your Seat and Mirrors",
      "description": "Adjust your seat so you can press the brake pedal fully to the floor without stretching your leg. You should have a slight bend in your knee. Adjust the steering wheel so your wrists rest on top of it when you extend your arms. Next, adjust your rearview mirror to see the entire rear window. Then, adjust your left and right side-view mirrors so you can just barely see the side of your own car in the inner edge of each mirror. This minimizes blind spots.",

The car will begin to creep forward at about 3-5 mph without any gas. Let it do this for a few feet. To go faster, pivot your right foot from the brake to the accelerator and apply extremely light, gentle pressure. Imagine there is an egg under your foot that you don't want to break. A small amount of pressure is all you need.",

To make a gentle turn, use the 'push-pull' method: if turning right, push the wheel up with your left hand and pull it down with your right hand, letting it slide through your grip.
